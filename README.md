## Milestones

- Using the Motor shield and Arduino only. Move the robot in a SQUARE.  Forward for 5 seconds. Turn Right 90 deg. Forward for 5 seconds. 	Turn Right 90 deg. Forward for 5 seconds. Turn Right 90 deg.	Forward for 5 seconds. Turn Right 90 deg. So roughly at the start point. Closest to start point wins.
- Same as 1 but LEFT 90 deg. Closest to start point wins.
- 1) and 2) combined in a random selection. Dice will be thrown for number of LEFT turns another dice for number of right turns. These will then go in to a “hat” and pulled out so in a random order. EG. 1st Dice (for Left) is 3, 2nd Dice (For right) is 5. 3 bits of paper marked with a L are put in the bag and 5 are written with R. Then they are mixed up and pulled out. So you may get the pattern RLRLRLRR. Closest to start point wins.
- Using the Line sensor follow a straight line and stop when the line ends within the stop zone that is 15cm. QUICKEST wins.
- Same as 4) but with corners. (Radius of no more than 15cm). QUICKEST wins (within 15cm stop zone).
